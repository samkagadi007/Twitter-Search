Twitter Search without authentication (Twitter username dictionary/list):

Run "bash twitter_search.sh keyword_file.txt twitter_usernames"

Here "keyword_file.txt" contains search keys.
This will give max 10 usernames for the search key.
And the final result will be saved into file twitter_usernames.unique.txt

The result set can be used as dictionary in bruteforce attack.
